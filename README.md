## üìù Overview
This is the official repository for [Language Models (Mostly) Know When to Stop Reading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01025) (NeurIPS 2025). The repo contains the original implementation of the paper, including both the datasets and source code. Check out the project [website](https://royxie.com/when-to-stop-project/) for more information.

## üì¶ Prerequisites
`Python 3.10` is recommended. You can create a virtual environment and install the required packages as follows:
```bash
python -m venv when-to-stop-env
source when-to-stop-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
Running the pipeline also requires an OpenAI API key for evaluation. You can export your OpenAI API key as follows: 
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your OpenAI api key>".
```

## üîß Training & Evaluation Configuration
You can adjust configuration parameters, such as the `number of data points`, `number of heads`, `classification threshold`, or `evaluation methods`, by editing the following file: 
```bash
src/config.py
```

## üöÄ Evaluate the Pipeline
Run the full pipeline, which will first `probe` the model to select the most sufficient heads, then `train` the classifier on the selected heads, and finally `evaluate` the results. You can use a Llama 3.2 1B model as an example with the following command:
```bash
python src/run.py --model_name meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct --data_dir "data/short" --output_dir "./results" 
```
